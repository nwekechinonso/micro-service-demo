Kindly use the steps below to deploy the sockshop application using terraform 

in this project, we have 7 .tf files, all serving their propose

>>> AKS.TF ---> for AKS deployment
>>> gra.tf ---> for grafana deployment
>>> provider.tf this help specify the provider and in this case, it is the azure provider
>>> role_assignment.tf ----> used to assign roles to the aks cluster
>>> socks_shop_app.tf ----> used to deploy the application using the complete-demo.yaml files
>>> vnet ---> used to deploy the networking component of aks
>>> cert.tf ---> used to secert your domain with letencrept


to deploy
1. cd to the directory microservices-demo/deploy/kubernetes
2. run terraform init
3. run terraform plan
4. run terraform apply

to map your domain to the public ip of the ingress 

after deployment of the clusters, 
> go to the cluter, under services and ingress, look for front-end and copy the public ip
> go to your domain provider and map the ip to your domain

to use letencrpt for TLS

run the below docker command i.e make sure docker is running on yoour local machine

docker run -it --rm -v /c/Users/path-to-your-webroot-file/webroot:/webroot certbot/certbot certonly --webroot -w /webroot -d sockshop.duckdns.org
the above will allow certbot to verify you have control of your domain, if you do, it will create a .crt and a .key file for you
add the path to the files in your cert.tf

monitoring

after deployment, you can go to your cluster, under "other resources" you will find grafana and promentus there
double click to enter the dashboard where you can find all 500 metric pobulated from the cluster
